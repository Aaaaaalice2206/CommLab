# Little Red Riding Hood: Screen Version
### A Digital Fairy Tale on the Phone Screen

A classic fairy tale retold through a simulated smartphone interface. 
Messages, maps, and notifications replace the wolf, turning everyday digital habits into a source of tension and danger.

## Abstract

This project adapts *Little Red Riding Hood* into an interactive web-based narrative experienced entirely through a simulated smartphone screen. The familiar fairy tale is placed into contemporary digital life in the form of chat messages, social feeds, location navigating, and system notifications. Instead of a wolf lurking in the forest, the danger emerges through the phone itself with persistent messages, invasive tracking, and unsettling alerts that slowly erode the sense of safety.

The guiding idea of creating this version is to reflect on a generation deeply obssessed with screens and often ignoring parental advice and physical reality in favor of digital connection. By using the web as both medium and message, this project attempts to immerse the viewer in a progression from warmth and familiarity to fear and darkness (with a bad ending) and encourage reflection on how digital dependence can quietly transform everyday tools into sources of real-world risk.
