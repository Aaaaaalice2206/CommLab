    <h2>Write to Your Future Self</h2>
    <p>
    You can guide yourself to write a letter to your future self six months from now.<br>
    It won't actually be sent, but will disappear automatically after writing,<br>
    or it will forever exist somewhere deep in a 404 page,  <br>symbolizing "no one will ever see it".
