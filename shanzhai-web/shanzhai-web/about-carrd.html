        <h1>What is Carrd?</h1>
        <p>Carrd is a simple, free tool for making one-page websites. No coding or design skills needed. It's fast, clean, and perfect for creating quick landing pages, portfolios, or personal sites.</p>
        <p>But what if we took that simplicity and added something darker? What if instead of just a clean design, we showed the cracks and raw emotions underneath?</p>
        <p>That's where Scarrd comes in. I've twisted Carrd’s simple beauty into something more... real. Something that’s broken, emotional, and honest.</p>
