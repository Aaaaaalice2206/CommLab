### Where Simplicity Meets Raw Emotion


**Scarrd** reimagines the simplicity of [Carrd](https://carrd.co/) with an emotional twist. It’s not just a website, it’s a place where users' feelings take center stage.

## Abstract  
In a world where most tutorials and templates guide us to create polished, perfect websites, **Scarrd** dares to challenge this norm. Inspired by the clean and minimalist design of Carrd, **Scarrd** adds a layer of vulnerability and emotion, which invites users to build not just one-page sites, but spaces that breathe with raw and unfiltered human experiences. Imagine a website that doesn’t just reflect your thoughts but embodies your feelings, where pages are no longer just a design, but canvases for your emotional journey. **Scarrd** empowers users to explore the intersection of design and emotion by transforming simple web pages into personal and vivid expressions of the self. Welcome to a space where your feelings can break free!

## About the Creator  
*Alice Guo*  

An ENFP and a Communications Lab Web Design Fall 2025 student at NYU Shanghai. As an extremely extroverted and highly feeling-driven individual, she was inspired to create Scarrd—a website that allows raw emotions to take center stage. A complete beginner in web design as she is, this project has been a journey of learning, and she’s excited to keep growing. She hopes users will be patient as she refines her skills and improves the project.
